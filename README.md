# Meteor-Shower
Meteor Shower is a hyper-casual game. The aim of the game is to protect our earth from incoming meteors. The game mechanics only work with finger taps on the screen. Each time the screen is tapped, the earth's orbit changes direction, so meteors can be avoided. Every 10 seconds, the speed of meteors and the orbital speed of the earth increase.
